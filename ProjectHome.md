CXS has developed a number of important X-ray analysis algorithms that it seeks to make available to other members of CXS and to the wider science community. The aim of this project is to provide a standard software package for these algorithms and for basic X-ray diffraction data analysis. In particular, it should allow new member of CXS to be introduced to the image reconstruction algorithms in a user-friendly way. In achieve this, the software must be well documented, efficient, robust and work on a number of different platforms.
