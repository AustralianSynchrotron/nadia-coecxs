This directory contains a set of examples which demonstrate how to use
the library and tools of this software package. Data file needed to
run the examples can be found in the "image_files" directory.

The examples should be compiled automatically after "make" is executed
in the base directory of this package. To recompile (e.g.  after
making modifications to the examples), type "make" in this directory.
To force a recompilation type "make clobber" followed by "make".

The current examples available are:

real_example
------------
This reconstructs some planar diffraction data (Lachie's data). The
shrinkwrap algorithm is used to improve the reconstruction. A combination
of HIO and the error-reduction algorithm are used.

simulation_example
------------------
The object from the real_example (in fact I used the reconstructed
image as the object) is used to simulate a diffraction pattern for
planar CDI. The diffraction pattern is thresholded to make it more
realistic and then CDI reconstruction is performed.

FCDI_WF_example
---------------
This example demonstrates how the phase of a white field can be
recovered and saved for use in Fresnel CDI reconstruction. The data set
comes from Corey.

FCDI_example
------------
The result of the previous example is used in Fresnel CDI
reconstruction. The error-reduction algorithm is used. The phase and
magnitude of the transmission function are output to file.
