	* rel_0
	* First version. To be used for testing purposes. 
	Only contains core functionality (planar and Fresnel
	CDI reconstruction)

	* rel_0.1
	* all: Some bug fixes to the last version. Most of them small.	
	* io_tiff.c (read_tiff): a major bug causing seg. faults in
	the file io_tiff.c was fixed.
	* inteface/idl: interface for idl has been created, but remains 
	to be documented and cleaned up.

	* clean up of examples and code in inteface/idl
	* optimisation of the PlanarCDI code. Fourier transforms
	are now performed in the Complex_2D class.
	* FresnelCDI_simulation_example.exe added and corresponding 
	image files.
	* write_tiff() written
	* fixed the scaling of images when output using write_tiff
	of write_ppm. The phase can not be viewed better.
