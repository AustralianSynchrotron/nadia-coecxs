 * This example aims at demonstrating how complex costraints can be
 * inforced during a reconstruction. The example requires that
 * FresnelCDI_WF_example.exe and FresnelCDI_simulation_example.c
 * have been previously run. 
 *
 * Here, the complex constraint is apply to the transmission function
 * during Fresnel reconstruction, but constraints such as charge
 * flipping can be achieve in the same way on th exit-surface wave for
 * plane-wave reconstruction.
